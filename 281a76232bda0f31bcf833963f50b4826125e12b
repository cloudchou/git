git-gui.tcl : change "evel exec comand" to  'eval [list git_read]'
 if we use 'eval exec $opt $cmdp $args' to execute git command, tcl engine will convert the output of the git comand with the rule  system default code page to unicode.
 But cp936 -> unicode conversion implicitly done by exec is not reversible.
 So we have to use git_read instead.
